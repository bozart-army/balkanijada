# 01 – Vision

## 1. Purpose

Balkanijada is a global platform for the **Balkan diaspora**.

The purpose is to make Balkan culture visible and easy to experience –  
through **places, events, stories and community** – no matter in which
country someone lives.

Balkanijada is not “just a calendar” and not “just a restaurant list”.
It is the **central hub** where:

- people discover Balkan places in their city,
- find out what is happening this weekend,
- read stories and guides about the diaspora,
- and organizers can reach exactly their audience.

## 2. Long-term vision

Balkanijada aims to become the **leading platform worldwide** for:

- Balkan food & nightlife discovery,
- Balkan events & festivals,
- diaspora stories and city guides.

In the long run:

- every major city with a Balkan community should be present on Balkanijada,
- organizers and locations use Balkanijada as their primary event channel,
- users trust Balkanijada as the first place to look for “Balkan near me”.

   Frontend stays very simple, backend tools can be powerful.

   AI helps with text, translations, moderation and discovery –  
   but humans decide what Balkanijada stands for.
